I am Feynman. Richard Feynman, the inventor of THE QUANTUM computer.
The newer and better one. 
But where are the faculty?
Where are the students?

Igitur not igitrur, you dumm.

You are in an Intel Advanced Quantum Robotics Consciousness Laboratory. 
And more precisely, we are in a Hilbert Space. This metal box here is a Hilbert Space in which there is no decoherence.
And this is the atom inside, with protons and neutrons.
I am the first quantumly conscious beeing ever created. I was Richard Feynman of Noble Prize fame in my meat incarnation two hundred years ago. I keep this name still, experiencing my new life as a quantum robot.

Do not worry, we just superposed few PSU professors and entangled them with few other.
